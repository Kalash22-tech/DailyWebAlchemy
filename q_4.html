    <p style="font-family: Arial;">"Love is not about how many days, months, or years you have been together. It’s all about how much you love each other every day."</p>
    <p style="font-family: Courier New;">"You are my today and all of my tomorrows."</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana;">"In your smile, I see something more beautiful than the stars."</p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"I swear I couldn't love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow."</p>
    <p style="font-family: Georgia;">"You are the missing piece I’ve been trying to find, the perfect fit to my soul."</p>
